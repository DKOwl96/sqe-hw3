# Running Selenium
Before running tests, you must open shell and run selenium server. To do so, run [selenium.bat](selenium.bat) (Windows) in command line. You will need to download a web driver running this script for the first time. 

## Installing a web driver
This folder includes a web driver for latest stable version of Chrome (version 108). If you have a different version (or different browsers), you will need to download a different web driver and replace the existing one. You can download the web drivers from [here](https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/#:~:text=Browsers).
