# Assignment 3: Software Quality Engineering
This is a repository for assignment 3 of the Software Quality Engineering course at the [Ben-Gurion University](https://in.bgu.ac.il/), Israel.

## Assignment Description
In this assignment, we tested an open-source software called $$*TODO* software name$$(https://address-of-the-project.com).

$$*TODO* Add some description about the software$$

## Installation
$$*TODO* Write instructions on how to install the software and prepare the testing environment$$

## What we tested
$$*TODO* Add a description of the user stories that you chose to test.
For example, in the case of the Moodle example you saw in the lecture, you can write something like this:

*User story:* A teacher adds a new quiz to the course with two yes/no questions

*Preconditions:* There is a course with a teacher

*User story:* A students attempts a quiz.

*Preconditions:* There is a course with a quiz with two yes/no questions.
$$

## How we tested
We used two different testing methods:
1. [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/), a BDD testing framework.
2. [Provengo](https://provengo.tech/), a story-based testing framework.

Each of the testing methods is elaborated in its own directory. 

## Results
Update all README.md files (except for d-e, see Section 1). Specifically, replace all $$*TODO*â€¦$$ according to the instructions inside the $$.
